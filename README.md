# Carbide

**Hardened C/C++ development standards and tooling for AI-assisted programming.**

Carbide helps developers—especially those new to C—write trustworthy, safe, and maintainable C code with AI assistance. It provides coding standards optimized for AI reasoning, validation tooling, and Claude Code slash commands that enforce best practices.

## Why Carbide?

C remains one of the most powerful languages for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications. However, C's flexibility comes with risks—memory corruption, undefined behavior, and security vulnerabilities are common pitfalls.

Carbide addresses this by:

1. **Standards designed for AI**: Clear, unambiguous rules that Claude Code can follow consistently
2. **Guardrails that prevent bad patterns**: Static analysis and security checks catch issues early
3. **Trust through validation**: Every check that passes builds confidence in generated code

## Quick Start

### Using Carbide Commands (No Setup Required)

These commands work on any C/C++ code:

```
/carbide-review path/to/file.c    # Review code against Carbide standards
/carbide-safety path/to/file.c    # Security-focused review
```

### Creating a Carbide Project

For full validation tooling:

```
/carbide-init my-project          # Create new project with full scaffold
cd my-project
make build                        # Compile
make check                        # Run static analysis
make safety                       # Run security checks
make test                         # Run tests with sanitizers
```

### Adding Carbide to an Existing Project

To integrate Carbide into an existing C/C++ project:

1. **Copy the install command** to your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   curl -o .claude/commands/carbide-install.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipLudington/Carbide/main/commands/carbide-install.md
   ```

2. **Run the install command** in Claude Code:
   ```
   /carbide-install
   ```

This will guide you through cloning Carbide, copying the necessary files, and configuring your project.

Once set up, use the Carbide slash commands:
```
/carbide-review src/main.c        # Review against standards
/carbide-check                    # Run validation tooling
/carbide-update                   # Update to latest version
```

### Carbide in Submodules

If your project includes submodules that also use Carbide, there's no conflict. Claude Code uses the `.claude/` directory at the **git root**, so only the parent project's commands and rules are active. The submodule's Carbide files are simply ignored when working from the parent project.

## What's Included

### Standards (`STANDARDS.md`)

Comprehensive coding standards covering:
- Naming conventions
- Memory management patterns
- Error handling
- API design
- Security practices

### Slash Commands (`commands/`)

| Command | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/carbide-install` | Setup | Install Carbide into an existing project |
| `/carbide-update` | Setup | Update Carbide to the latest version |
| `/carbide-init` | Setup | Create a new Carbide project |
| `/carbide-review` | Standalone | Review code against standards |
| `/carbide-check` | Integrated | Run validation tooling |
| `/carbide-safety` | Standalone | Security-focused code review |

### Claude Code Rules (`rules/`)

Auto-loaded rules that guide Claude Code's behavior for C/C++ development:
- `memory.md` - Ownership, allocation, NULL safety
- `errors.md` - Return values, error checking, cleanup
- `security.md` - Input validation, buffer safety
- `naming.md` - Case conventions, prefixes
- `api-design.md` - Config structs, const correctness
- `testing.md` - Test organization, sanitizers
- `concurrency.md` - Thread safety, mutexes
- `preprocessor.md` - Macro hygiene
- `logging.md` - Log levels, message format
- `portability.md` - Integer types, platform abstraction

### Validation Tooling

- **Makefile** with standard targets (`build`, `check`, `safety`, `test`, `format`, `clean`)
- **clang-tidy** configuration with curated rules
- **clang-format** configuration for consistent style
- **Sanitizer presets** (AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer)

### Pattern Documentation

Detailed guides in `docs/patterns/`:
- `memory.md` - Memory management patterns
- `errors.md` - Error handling patterns
- `api-design.md` - C API design patterns
- `resources.md` - Resource lifecycle patterns

### Security Documentation

Security-focused guides in `docs/security/`:
- `buffer-overflow.md` - Prevention techniques
- `injection.md` - Input validation patterns
- `memory-safety.md` - Safe memory practices

## Supported Toolchains

Carbide supports cross-platform development:

| Platform | Compilers |
|----------|-----------|
| macOS | Clang, GCC |
| Linux | GCC, Clang |
| Windows | MSVC, Clang, GCC (MinGW) |

## Design Philosophy

1. **Prescriptive over permissive**: Clear rules are easier to follow than vague guidelines
2. **Explicit over implicit**: Memory ownership, error states, and lifetimes should be obvious
3. **Validated over assumed**: If it can be checked automatically, it should be
4. **Simple over clever**: Readable code beats clever optimizations
5. **Secure by default**: Security patterns should be the path of least resistance
